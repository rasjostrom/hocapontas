======

hocapontas is a small library for managing every day tasks like planning,
budgetizing, etc. As of right now, it uses a simple plain text json file to
keep track of data and is only capable of simple task scheduling.

The main idea for hocapontas is to be easily integrated with other web
applications or bots (such as a slack bot). The only worry should be about
collecting and displaying data in a desired way.
